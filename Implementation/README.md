We will share our project in Github.
Once you have our files downloaded you should run the project on your phone by plugging your phone into your laptop. You can do this by selecting the demo device
as your own phone. This dropdown menu appears at the top right of the Xcode interface. Once you have selected your device you will also need to enable on your phones
end. Do this by going to settings > general > profiles and device management > and click on the developer app. Then when you run the code on your Xcode, you will see
the app pop up on your iphone. This is neccesary to do because the texting and calling features imbedded in our app will not work on the fake iphone displays
that Xcode provides. We designed our UI for an iPhone 8. It will work well with iphones of similar size. We did not set our user interface for a horizontal mode or
to fit an iPad.

Once you have done that`you can play around on our app. The main menu will present the various grills to you. Ill walk you through an example usage that you can follow:
Click on Dunster Grill > scroll through the menu and select whatever you would like to eat > once you are finished, type your name and submit your order > this will
redirect you to your messages where you can send your order > now you can quit the app, wait 10 - 15 minutes and go enjoy your food! (in reality we linked these
buttons to our personal numbers so please dont send to many calls or texts)

You can also try using our info page. Scroll through it to see each grills hours and info. You can also call the grills with the contact buttons.
